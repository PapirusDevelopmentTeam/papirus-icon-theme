> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Attention package maintainers**
> In case you missed the previous release, I should remind you to pay attention to the previous [release notes](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/releases/tag/20231101) regarding the ePapirus icon theme.

## Highlights

Since this release we drop support for old distros, like

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Debian 10 Buster
- elementary OS 0.4 Loki
- elementary OS 5.0 Juno
- elementary OS 5.1 Hera
- RHEL 7
- RHEL 8

and others released before 2020. A lot of legacy icons have been removed and will be removed in the future. If you're a user of these ancient distros, [20230901](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/releases/tag/20230901) is the most suitable option.

## Highlights

The release actually hasn't the highlight, let's call it a maintenance release. It seems like this is the first release where more files have been removed than added (**-1338** vs **+269**). Anyway, there is one notable change:

- Debian package in our [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~papirus/+archive/ubuntu/papirus) was split to `papirus-icon-theme` and `epapirus-icon-theme` packages #3563

**For PPA users**

In most cases, you will not see the difference. If recommended packages are not denied on your system, `epapirus-icon-theme` package will be installed as before, but now you can remove ePapirus and ePapirus-Dark icon theme using `sudo apt remove epapirus-icon-theme`, in case you're not an elementaryOS user.

**For package maintainers**

The default behavior didn't change. The Makefile still installs all the available icon themes. But we recommend two options to deal with ePapirus and ePapirus-Dark themes:

1. If your distro supports [Pantheon Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_OS#Pantheon_desktop_environment) please split the package to `papirus-icon-theme` (Papirus, Papirus-Dark, Papirus-Light), and `epapirus-icon-theme` (ePapirus, ePapirus-Dark).  epapirus-icon-theme should have `papirus-icon-theme` as dependency. See example for [deb package](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/635c7bc416edd41b028a328df61ffae4cf053a7c).
2. If your distro does **NOT** support [Pantheon Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_OS#Pantheon_desktop_environment), please exclude ePapirus and ePapirus-Dark from `papirus-icon-theme` package using EXCLUDE notation: `make EXCLUDE="ePapirus ePapirus-Dark" install`.

This saves up to 17309 inodes and up to 72MB of disk space for your users.

Also, if you've previously used the `IGNORE=` notation in your build script, this release introduces a couple of breaking changes (1e76dbab9865a2536c4d7ebe06a5728471fd2152 and 5183e15de4b042ca4c2e901588a63f71acae3d57). So, if you've been using a command like `make IGNORE="./ePapirus ./ePapirus-Dark" install` in your build script, please update it to use the new command: `make EXCLUDE="ePapirus ePapirus-Dark" install`.
